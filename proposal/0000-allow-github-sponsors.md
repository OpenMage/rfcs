# Rules for linking and referencing Sponsoring options for Contributors and Maintainers

## Summary

Allow Contributors and Maintainers to allow advertising their Sponsorship accounts at places like "Github Sponsors", Patreon, and similar.



## Motivation

As some of the contributors and maintainers work on OpenMage fully voluntairy without (or without enough) direct or indirect benefit, it makes sense to allow them advertising for a sponsorship Programm.

## Detailed Explanation

We have contributors who do this fully voluntary, without having a job or work related to the project delivering revenue.
We also currently have no legal entity, which can accept and distribute money to where its usefull.
But we can link and also list sponsorhip options as part of the project.

## Rationale and Alternatives

The Rational is, contributors should have a chance to profit from their work on the project
{{Discuss 2-3 different alternative solutions that were considered. This is required, even if it seems like a stretch. Then explain why this is the best choice out of available ones.}}

## Implementation

We use the `/.github/FUNDING.yml` file documented at https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository and allow people adding one "custom link" the the main project repository.

It is allowed for anyone to be added to who did contribute at least on 4 different months during the last 2 years.
Any kind of contribution does count, including "documentation, website content, code reviews, patches" and also every not here specyfied contribution. 


At the moment when OpenMage has their own Organisation level Sponsoring, all individual sponsoring links which are covered by this RFCs are going to get removed. (They might qualify for returning, in case the organizational sponsoring is closed again).

Violations against the Code of Conduct can involve removal as well as banning from beeing listed for Sponsoring.

# Release Schedule

## Summary

Defining the Schedule and rules for new releases
{{A concise, one-paragraph description of the change.}}

## Motivation

Its important to have a reliability for long term plans, we can offer this by following a consistent schedule with hard rules.
{{Why are we doing this? What pain points does this resolve? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? Use real, concrete examples to make your case!}}

## Detailed Explanation

{{Describe the expected changes in detail, }}

## Rationale and Alternatives


{{Discuss 2-3 different alternative solutions that were considered. This is required, even if it seems like a stretch. Then explain why this is the best choice out of available ones.}}

## Implementation

We will follow the example of Ubuntu, which bases the Major Version Number on the Year.  
And also has a specific Rythmus of an LTS version every 4 Releases,
adding bigger experimantal features in the Major Release after an LTS version.

But we will go with just one Major Release each year, which results in one LTS Release every 4 years.



{{Give a high-level overview of implementation requirements and concerns. Be specific about areas of code that need to change, and what their potential effects are. Discuss which repositories and sub-components will be affected, and what its overall code effect might be.}}

{{THIS SECTION IS REQUIRED FOR RATIFICATION -- you can skip it if you don't know the technical details when first submitting the proposal, but it must be there before it's accepted}}
